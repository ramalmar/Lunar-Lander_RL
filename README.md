# Solving the lunar lander environment using Reinforcement learning

The purpose of this work is to develop a reinforcement learning model capable of solving the problem presented by the "Moon Lander" environment in the Gymnasium library. The objective is to train a model that can make decisions to successfully land the spaceship on the moon's surface with a smooth landing. Finally the evaluation of the working and performance wil be presented.
